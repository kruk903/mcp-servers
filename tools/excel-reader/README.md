# Excel Reader

This is a standalone Python script that can open and print the full contents of
`.xlsx` (Excel) and `.csv` files. It does not rely on external packages and
uses only the Python standard library.

## Usage

```bash
python3 excel_reader.py path/to/file.xlsx
```

The script will print each worksheet to the console in a tab-separated format.
CSV files are printed line by line.
